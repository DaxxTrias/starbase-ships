# Known Issues

- There is very limited coverage of range finders for the crash avoidance system. It also hasn't been tested extensively. **Use at your own risk!**
- Autopilot doesn't seem to point ship directly to destination (a bit off), the parameters of the system probably need to be adjusted and tested more.
