| Interface | Function |
|---|---|
| `ForwardThrust` | Current forward thrust, maximum of 10,000 units |
| `Cruise` | Activates cruise control, forward thrust will not reset to zero unless turned down. |
| `Aim` | Reduces the response time of key presses for pitch and yaw. |
| `Turtle` | Activates turtle mode which sets forward thrust to a maximum limit of 20% of full thrust. |
| `Sloth` | Activates the low sensitvity mode by limiting all thrust to 20%. Using together with `Turtle` will result in even slower forward thrust. |
| `Fuel` | Fuel remaining on fuel rod, maximum of 300,000 units. |
| `Propellant` | Total propellant remaining in propellant tanks, maximum of 2,000,000 units. |
| `Battery` | Shows current battery charge of the 20 batteries, maximum of 10,000 units. |
| `Generator` | Current generator rate, maximum of 100%. |
| `HeatTransferRate` | Current heat transfer rate of the heat sinks, maximum of 100%. |
| `ID` | Activates transponder |
