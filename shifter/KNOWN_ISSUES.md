# Known Issues

- There is limited coverage of range finders for the crash avoidance system. **Use at your own risk!**
- Autopilot doesn't seem to point ship directly to destination (a bit off), use in conjunction with NavGrid.
- Right/left strafe will spin the ship slightly as well.
- There may be a slight drift when crates start to fill, especially at low speeds.
