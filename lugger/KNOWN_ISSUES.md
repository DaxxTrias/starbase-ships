# Known Issues

- There is limited coverage of range finders for the crash avoidance system. **Use at your own risk!**
- Autopilot doesn't seem to point ship directly to destination (a bit off), use in conjunction with NavGrid.
- The ship is pretty much at its voxel limit so any additions or changes may be difficult without sacrificing crates.
