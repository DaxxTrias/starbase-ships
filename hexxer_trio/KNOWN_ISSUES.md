# Known Issues

- When asteroids are loaded more on one side, the ship can become unbalanced and appraoch will not work as well. Manual appraoch would probably be better.
- Currently there are no navigation features but will possibly add ISAN and Compass in the future if this ship becomes useful to Endos
